# Automated-IP-Allow-List-Management-System
This project involves developing an automated system to manage IP address allow lists. By using an algorithm, the system continuously updates the "allow_list.txt" file to ensure that only authorized IP addresses can access sensitive information, while efficiently removing any unauthorized IP addresses.
